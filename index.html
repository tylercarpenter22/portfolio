                    <h2>Hello, I'm Tyler</h2>
                    <p>I’m an Information Technology student at the University of Central Florida with a strong passion for programming and problem-solving. 
                    As a teaching assistant for Computer Architecture, I’m dedicated to helping students grasp complex concepts and develop a deeper appreciation for the subject.</p>
        
                    <p>I enjoy solving challenges through code and am always eager to expand my skills and knowledge in the ever-evolving tech landscape. 
                    My primary interests include programming, cybersecurity, and networking, and I’m committed to developing my expertise to contribute to impactful solutions in the IT field.</p>
        
                    <p>Over the past year, I’ve had the opportunity to explore a range of exciting technologies by developing projects that are both practical and personally engaging. 
                    I’m currently preparing for the CompTIA Security+, Network+, and Linux+ exams, which I plan to take in July.</p>
        
                    <p>Feel free to explore my projects, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you're interested in collaborating or discussing potential opportunities!</p>
